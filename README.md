About

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? Two cups. Press a couple of buttons on the machine, and, voilà,
a burst of raw energy is in your hands. But first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on a 
coffee machine simulator. This machine uses regular ingredients — coffee, milk, and plastic cups. Should it run out of something, it will 
show you a notification. Our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing is for free, 
it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.

Project has 6 stages:

  1. "Making coffee" - Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen. Let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!
  2. "Ingredient calculator" - The machine should calculate how many ingredients it needs to make the required amount of coffee. 
  3. "Coffee for all" - Program the machine to calculate how many cups it can make based on the number of set ingredients.
  4. "Buy, fill, take!" - Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, replenish the supplies, and serve the coffee. 
  5. "Keeping track of the supplies" - Program the machine to display how many supplies it has on the screen. 
  Work on the main loop: now, the menu keeps updating until users choose to exit. 
  6. "The sandbox" - Enhance your coffee machine with any new functionality you wish to add.
